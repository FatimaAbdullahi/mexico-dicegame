 The Mexico Dice Game
---------------------------------

For general overview and rules see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_(game)
For a run of the game see below.

Simplifications:
    - Any randomly chosen player starts.
    - If more players have the same lowest result of a round, the first
    (or randomly selected) is the looser (no replay).
    - players throw two dices, result from the two dices put next to each other forming one number, the player
    with the highest score wins the round while the players with least score loses some of his money(amount), the
    game will continue until only one person left, for scoring not equal dices < equal dices < 21(mexico-highest score 1000)
    - the leader determines the number of rolls

    
Clarifications:
    - If a player rolls more than MAX_ROLLS (see example below) or the number of
    rolls of the leader an automatic switch to next player will occur.



    indexOf() - the array index of some player
    next() - the player following the current player
    getScore(),- get score for a player
    getLoser() - get player with lowest score
    not equal dices < equal dices < mexico. example: score 32<22<21(mexico)
